## Key Learnings:
1. **INNER JOIN** is like the intersection of two circles in a Venn diagram - only matching records.

2. **LEFT JOIN** keeps all records from the left table and matching records from the right.

3. **FULL OUTER JOIN** combines all records from both tables, with NULLs where no match exists.

4. Always consider which table should be the "base" (left table) in your joins.

5. Use table aliases (like 'p' for properties) to make queries more readable.

6. The order of joins can impact performance with large datasets.
